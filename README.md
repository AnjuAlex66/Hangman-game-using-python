# Hangman-game-using-python

Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a simple yet engaging Hangman game using Python. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project demonstrates basic concepts of game development, user input handling, and visual feedback in a command-line environment.

 About the Game

The Hangman game operates as follows:

- The player is given a random word to guess, represented by underscores.
- The player guesses one letter at a time.
- If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the word.
- If the guessed letter is incorrect, the player loses a life.
- The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Case-insensitive letter guessing.
- Display of the current word state and remaining lives.
- Visual representation of the hangman figure based on remaining lives.
